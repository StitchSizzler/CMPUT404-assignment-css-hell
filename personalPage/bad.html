                        <p>I am in my final year of Computing Science at the University of Alberta. 
                            I have internship and work experience in front-end development.
                            I am pursuing a certificate in Computer Games Development along with my degree.

                        <h4>Professional History</h4>
                        <p>I have finished a 16-month internship at Dotdash, a digital media publishing company. 
                            I am currently working their part-time as a front-end engineer.
                            I will resume my work as a full-time employee after graduating.
                        </p>

                        <h4>What can I do for you?</h4>
                        <p>Through crushing school deadlines, I have learned to work under pressure.
                            Through group projects, I have learned to work with different kinds of people.
                            However, I'd rather not do anything at the moment :p
